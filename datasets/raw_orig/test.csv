DM-4,Transition git repositories to Stash https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-text-mining/lecture/wh4nJ/demonstration-regex-with-pandas-and-named-groups,Transition gitolite-managed repositories to Atlassian Stash.,10
DM-8,Finalize DM mission statement.,"The proposed mission statement for the LSST Software Stack development: {quote} Enabling LSST science by creating a well documented, state-of-the-art, high-performance, scalable, multi-camera, open source, O/IR survey data processing and analysis system {quote} with the following rationale:  * well documented -- as otherwise it will be impossible to maintain or be usable for Level 3 * state-of-the-art -- because the quality of the instrument and needs of the science to be systematic limited require us to develop new algorithms an break new ground in a number of areas * high-performance -- because of the massive amount of data we need to process for a reasonable budget * scalable -- because we need it to run from between a single core (for developers, or Level 3 users) to tens of thousands of cores (for Data Release production) * multi-camera -- because we need to process precursor data for development purposes, and because our as-delivered camera won't be ideal. * open source -- because we want the community and future surveys to benefit from our efforts. ",2
DM-9,Open up LSST software mailing lists.,"We all benefit from making LSST software development as open as possible and conducive to outside volunteer contributions (*). One way to increase community involvement is to open up our development mailing lists to the public, analogous to the way other open source projects do. For example, we could have:  * software-devel@lsstcorp.org: the development mailing list, equivalent to current lsst-data * software-users@lsstcorp.org: the users mailing list, equivalent to current lsst-dm-stack-users mailing list (but it could possibly be replaced by StackOverflow/Confluence Questions) * lsst-dm@lsstcorp.org: internal, DM-staff only mailing list, for the *rare* discussions/notices that should go out to staff only.  (*) Though we don't rely on them for meeting the project specs (legally required disclaimer :) ).",1
DM-10,"Transition, to Confluence Questions?","Open the Confluence Questions site, for interaction with the community (and to enable community self-help).  ",10
DM-17,Add derivatives-based optimizer to meas_multifit,"See https://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/ticket/3146  Story points estimate is for remaining work only (just the code review, which is still substantial).",10

DM-25,Build Winter'14 release.,Run lsst-build scripts and 'eups distrib create' to build the Winter'14 release.,1
DM-26,Update installation instructions,Update Confluence instructions on how to install the Winter'14 stack.  The instructions are at: https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LSWUG/LSST+Software+User+Guide,1
DM-28,Modify gitolite permissions to allow issue/DM-NNNN branches,"Use issue/DM-NNNN branches for issues tracked in JIRA, to differentiate them from tickets/NNNN branches that are still in Trac.",1
DM-52,Qserv configuration - detailed design,Detailed design covering how all Qserv components will be configured for runtime. ,3
DM-53,Node configuration and bootstrapping - detailed design,"Design covering how all Qserv components will be configured for runtime.  Design how new Qserv nodes will be bootstrapped when we add them to the cluster, and how already added nodes will get updated after they were offline (crashed, turned off for maintenance etc) ",6
